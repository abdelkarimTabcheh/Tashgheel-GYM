# Friend System Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive friend system that has been implemented for the Tash8eel fitness app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Search Functionality
- **Search Bar**: Added above the leaderboard to search for users
- **Real-time Search**: Search by name or email with minimum 2 characters
- **Search Modal**: Full-screen modal with search results and add friend buttons

### 2. Friend System
- **Add Friends**: Send friend requests to other users
- **Friend Status**: Shows current relationship status (none, pending, accepted, rejected)
- **Friend Requests**: Accept or reject incoming friend requests
- **Friend List**: View all accepted friends

### 3. Dual Leaderboard Sections
- **All Users**: Shows all users with add friend buttons
- **Friends Only**: Shows only friends' streaks and stats
- **Tab Navigation**: Easy switching between sections

### 4. Notification System
- **Friend Request Notifications**: Get notified when someone sends a friend request
- **Accept/Reject Notifications**: Notifications for friend request responses
- **Notification Badge**: Shows unread notification count
- **Notification Screen**: Dedicated screen to manage all notifications

## Backend API Endpoints

### Friend Endpoints
- `POST /api/friends/request` - Send friend request
- `POST /api/friends/accept` - Accept friend request
- `POST /api/friends/reject` - Reject friend request
- `GET /api/friends/list` - Get user's friends
- `GET /api/friends/pending` - Get pending friend requests
- `GET /api/friends/search` - Search users
- `GET /api/friends/leaderboard` - Get friends leaderboard

### Notification Endpoints

- `PUT /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark notification as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all notifications as read
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

## Database Models

### Friend Model
```javascript
{
  requester: ObjectId, // User who sent the request
  recipient: ObjectId, // User who receives the request
  status: String, // 'pending', 'accepted', 'rejected'
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Notification Model
```javascript
{
  recipient: ObjectId, // User who receives the notification
  sender: ObjectId, // User who triggered the notification
  type: String, // 'friend_request', 'friend_accepted', 'friend_rejected'
  title: String,
  message: String,
  isRead: Boolean,
  relatedData: Object, // Additional data (e.g., friendRequestId)
  createdAt: Date
}
```

## Frontend Components

### Services
- `friendService.js` - Handles all friend-related API calls
- `notificationService.js` - Handles all notification-related API calls

### Screens
- `StreakLeaderboardScreen.js` - Enhanced with search and friend functionality
- `NotificationScreen.js` - New screen for managing notifications

### Components
- `Header.js` - Enhanced with notification icon and badge
- `NotificationBadge.js` - Reusable notification badge component

## How to Use

### Adding Friends
1. Go to the Streak Leaderboard screen
2. Use the search bar to find users
3. Click "Add Friend" button next to any user
4. The other user will receive a notification

### Managing Friend Requests
1. Click the notification bell icon in the header
2. View incoming friend requests
3. Click "Accept" or "Reject" to respond

### Viewing Friends
1. In the Streak Leaderboard, switch to the "Friends" tab
2. See only your friends' streaks and stats

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
- All friend and notification endpoints require authentication
- Uses JWT tokens for user identification

### Real-time Updates
- Notifications are created immediately when friend requests are sent
- UI updates in real-time when accepting/rejecting requests

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues

### Performance
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Pagination for notifications
- Optimized search with minimum character requirements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for instant notifications
2. **Friend Suggestions**: AI-powered friend recommendations
3. **Group Challenges**: Create challenges with multiple friends
4. **Friend Activity Feed**: See friends' recent activities
5. **Push Notifications**: Mobile push notifications for friend requests

## Security Considerations

- Users cannot send friend requests to themselves
- Friend relationships are unique (no duplicates)
- Proper authorization checks for all operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints (recommended)

## Testing

To test the friend system:

1. Create multiple user accounts
2. Send friend requests between accounts
3. Accept/reject requests
4. Verify notifications appear correctly
5. Check that friend leaderboard shows only friends
6. Test search functionality with various queries

## Dependencies

### Backend
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Express.js
- JWT for authentication

### Frontend
- React Native
- Redux for state management
- Axios for API calls
- React Navigation for routing
